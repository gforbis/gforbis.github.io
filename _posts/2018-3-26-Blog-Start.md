title: Formally moving blog presense to Github
---

I've moved my blogging here because it seems a more natural fit for a developer, because I wanted a clean break from my old blog, and because it lets me write and format things offline. There will be some test posts and perhaps some hand-migrated content and then I'll be back to my erratic posting schedule.
