### About Me

My name is Gary. I've been a full-stack developer since before it had a name. The technologies I'm most familiar with are Java, JEE, Javascript (including JQuery), CSS, REST, AJAX, Domino, JSF, XPages, Servlets, DB2, and MS-SQL. I work very hard to stay abreast of current technologies and I've also had limited experience (personal development / tinkering) with ASP.NET (Core), Angular2, Linux (Mint and CentOS), Apache, Tomcat, Maven, Git, MariaDB, and MongoDB. I'm currently learning Spring because it seems a natural transition for someone familiar with JSF. My day-to-day work is primarily Java/JSF/XPages.

I study design patterns and best practices and continually strive to improve the code I write. Every project I complete, I reflect on what could have been done better and carry those ideas forward to the next. I've worked on solo projects and enjoyed collaboration - there is almost always something to learn and something to teach.

### About This Blog

I don't claim to be an expert. I spend my time writing software and researching why things don't align with my expectations. This means I blog about things that have actually caused me problems, and it means the answers I find may be incomplete. Also, while I do my best to research, understand, and apply best practices before posting, sometimes providing code examples that fully adhere to them can be distracting from the point of a post. *Caveat emptor*
