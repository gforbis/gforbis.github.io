My name is Gary. I've been a full-stack developer since before it had a name. The technologies I'm most familiar with are Java, JEE, Javascript (including JQuery), CSS, REST, AJAX, Domino, JSF, XPages, Servlets, DB2, and MS-SQL. I work very hard to stay abreast of current technologies and I've also had limited experience (personal development / tinkering) with ASP.NET (Core), Angular2, Linux (Mint and CentOS), Apache, Tomcat, Maven, Git, MariaDB, and MongoDB. I'm currently learning Spring because it seems a natural transition for someone familiar with JSF. My day-to-day work is primarily Java/JSF/XPages.

I study design patterns and best practices and continually strive to improve the code I write. Every project I complete, I reflect on what could have been done better and carry those ideas forward to the next. I've worked on solo projects and enjoyed collaboration - there is almost always something to learn and something to teach.

### More Information

I'm originally from Michigan and currently living and working south of Washington, D.C. Eventually, my family wants to move back to (or near) Michigan to be nearer to family.
